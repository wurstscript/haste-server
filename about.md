# WurstBin

Sharing code is a good thing, and it should be _really_ easy to do it.
A lot of times, I want to show you something I'm seeing - and that's where we
use pastebins.

WurstBin is the prettiest, easiest to use pastebin for Wurst and Jass resources.

## Basic Usage

Type what you want me to see, click "Save", and then copy the URL.  Send that
URL to someone and they'll see what you see.

To make a new entry, click "New" (or type 'control + n')

Pastes will stay for about 6 months from their last view. They may be removed earlier
and without notice. I'm planning to add permanent pastes at some point.

## Privacy

While the contents of bin.wurstlang.org are not directly crawled by any search robot
that obeys "robots.txt", there should be no great expectation of privacy. Post
things at your own risk. Not responsible for any loss of data or removed
pastes.
